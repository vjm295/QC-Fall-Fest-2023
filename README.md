A Qiskit implementation of the classic game Snake (credis to edureka for the template)
In this version of Snake, players control a snake with the ability to pass through obstacles.
However, this is uncertain and determied by a quantum gate that sets the state into superposition.
Players need to use this to navigate the game safely and avoid death traps.
